#### By now, you would have seen the use of many links in the previous few notes. 

#### Links are extremely useful when writing notes. Using links allows you to connect your notes, while keeping each note concise and easy to read. 

#### As seen on the right, graphs can help you:

* ##### Trace links in your notes easily and,
* ##### Find nested notes quick

#### To link another note, simple use double square brackets: 
##### `[[some random note]]`
#### and it turns into a clickable link!

#### To create a link to a website, there are 3 methods:

* ##### The first and quickest method, is simply pasting the link into the note:
	* ##### eg. https://nossalhs-vic.compass.education/

* ##### If you want to get fancy, the second method uses link text
	* ##### By placing a descriptor of the website in square brackets (`[]`), and placing the link in regular brackets immediately after, you get the following result:
		* `[Compass](https://nossalhs-vic.compass.education/)` = [Compass](https://nossalhs-vic.compass.education/)

* ##### The third method is a repeat of the second, but with a title that appears when you hover over the link.
	* ##### To do so, just include some text in quotations after the url, and you get the following result:
		* `[Compass](https://nossalhs-vic.compass.education/ "Compass...very reliable website...")` = [Compass](https://nossalhs-vic.compass.education/ "Compass...very reliable website...")

#### Another use for links is an index page, where you can couple lists and links to create a note that removes the hassle of going through the graphs and folders to find the note you want to.
