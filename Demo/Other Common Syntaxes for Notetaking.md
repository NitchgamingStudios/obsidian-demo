## Blockquotes

#### Blockquotes are useful for including, like the names says, quotes. Blockquotes can be coupled with other elements, such as headers and any text emphasis. 

#### To create a blockquote, simple add the greater than ">" symbol in front of your text like you would with headers

> This is how a blockquote looks like.
>>  You can even make nested blockquotes!

## Lists

#### Lists are equally essential when taking notes. There are 2 types of lists:

* #### Ordered Lists and,
* #### Unordered lists

#### Like blockquotes, lists can also be coupled with other elements.

#### Ordered lists can be easily created like how you would in other apps like OneNote or Word. Just add line items with numbers followed by periods.
