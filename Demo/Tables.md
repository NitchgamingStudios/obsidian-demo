#### To create a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column.

#### It's a good idea to keep a template of a table ready to use as it is a hassle to have to manually set up a table every time you ned one.

#### The table formatting looks like this:
```
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
```

#### And the rendered output will appear as:
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

#### The width of a cell can vary, and the output will still appear the same.
