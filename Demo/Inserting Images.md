#### Images are useful to help represent key ideas and be a memory stimulator for notes that were not written down.

#### Attaching an image is incredibly simple.
#### Similar to inserting links, alt text (image descriptor) goes in square brackets, and the url goes in the regular brackets. 
#### This only produces a link though, and requires the additional step of adding an exclamation mark in front of the syntax.

###### eg. `![An image of a monkey](https://i.natgeofe.com/n/bb13f61c-edaa-4ad9-8230-879a2d2d1ad4/6924567_2x1.jpg)`
